## Abstract

The Antifragile Prompting (AFP) Framework is not a collection of prompt tricks,  
but a resilient system designed to thrive in complexity and uncertainty.  

It emphasizes antifragility: when stressed, the system does not collapse, but  
adapts and evolves through feedback loops. SafeLoop, AFP’s core mechanism,  
ensures safe, iterative prompting cycles that keep AI outputs under control  
while continuously improving.
