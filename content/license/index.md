## Antifragile Prompting (AFP) / SafeLoop  
### Copyright & Attribution Statement

**Work Title**: Antifragile Prompting Framework (AFP), also known as **SafeLoop**  
**Version**: Public Use Edition | Minimal & Stable Skeleton  

---

### Why make it public?

Making the framework public establishes authorship with a clear **timestamp**,  
which is widely recognized in both open-source and academic communities.  
Repositories and preprints serve as evidence of priority and originality.

### License & Commitments

- **Attribution**: Original author: **CHING HUI KAI**.  
  Usage, modification, and redistribution are welcome,  
  but attribution with author name and publication date is required.  

- **License**: Released under  
  [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  

- **Versioning**: Future releases (e.g., full AFP Whitepaper)  
  will also be timestamped and published openly.

### Why is it safer after publishing?

Public release strengthens protection:  
if someone copies without attribution,  
the internet record and timestamp serve as proof of authorship.  
Community norms also encourage proper citation.
