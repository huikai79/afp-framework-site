## Executive Summary

Antifragile Prompting (AFP) Framework is not a handbook of tricks, but a resilient prompting system designed for complexity and uncertainty.
It emphasizes antifragility: under stress, the system does not collapse, but adapts and evolves through feedback loops.
SafeLoop, the core mechanism of AFP, provides a secure, iterative prompting cycle to keep AI outputs under control while continuously improving.
