## Executive Summary

The Antifragile Prompting Framework (AFP) is not a set of tricks, but an engineering layer for prompt governance.
It enables AI systems to stay controllable, reproducible, and explainable even in complex or high-risk environments.

At its core, AFP embraces antifragility: systems under stress do not collapse, but evolve through feedback loops.
It is not a quick fix ‚Äî it is a long-term quality assurance mechanism.

SafeLoop, AFP‚Äôs core cycle, provides transparent and iterative prompting loops, ensuring every AI output grows within a verifiable track.
No matter how advanced models become, AFP remains the key layer for trustworthy outputs, traceability, and standardization.
