**Official Attribution Statement for the AFP / SafeLoop Skeleton (Public Release)**

---

## Copyright & Attribution

**Work Title**: Antifragile Prompting Framework (AFP), also known as **SafeLoop**  
**Version**: Public Use Edition | Minimal & Stable Skeleton  

### Why make it public?
Making the framework public establishes authorship with a clear timestamp,  
which is widely recognized in both open-source and academia.  
Preprints and open repositories serve as evidence of priority and originality.  

### License & Commitments
- **Attribution**: Original author: **CHING HUI KAI**.  
  Usage, modification, and redistribution are welcome,  
  but proper attribution with author name and publication date is required.  
- **License**: This project’s text and documentation are released under  
  **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**.  
- **Versioning**: Future releases (e.g., full AFP Whitepaper) will also be timestamped and published openly.  

### Why is it safer after publishing?
Public release strengthens protection: if someone copies without attribution,  
the internet record and timestamp serve as proof of authorship.  
The community itself helps enforce proper citation.
