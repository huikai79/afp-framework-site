**Official Attribution Statement for the AFP / SafeLoop Skeleton (Public Release)**

---

## Copyright & Attribution

**Work Title**: Antifragile Prompting Framework (AFP), also known as **SafeLoop**  
**Version**: Public Use Edition | Minimal & Stable Skeleton  

### Why make it public?
Making the framework public establishes authorship with a clear timestamp,  
which is widely recognized in both open-source and academia.  
Preprints and open repositories serve as evidence of priority and originality.  

### License & Commitments
- **Attribution**: Original author: **CHING HUI KAI**.  
  Usage, modification, and redistribution are welcome,  
  but proper attribution with author name and publication date is required.  
- **License**: This project’s text and documentation are released under  
  **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**.  
- **Versioning**: Future releases (e.g., full AFP Whitepaper) will also be timestamped and published openly.  

### Why is it safer after publishing?
Public release strengthens protection: if someone copies without attribution,  
the internet record and timestamp serve as proof of authorship.  
The community itself helps enforce proper citation.

## Project Description

Antifragile Prompting (AFP) / SafeLoop is a **resilient prompting framework**  
designed to remain stable and adaptive in complex, uncertain environments.  

- **SafeLoop**: The core mechanism — a secure, iterative prompting cycle.  
- **Positioning**: Not just a “bag of tricks,” but a robust conceptual skeleton.  
- **Applications**: Useful for research, AI safety, education, and decision-making.

## Execution Rules (Summary)

This project follows a **minimal operational protocol** to ensure  
clarity, reproducibility, and antifragile growth:

- **Safety & Evidence**: compliance > all; cite sources or mark as [assumption] + [verification path].  
- **Delivery**: always ship a minimal viable answer (MVP) first, refine later.  
- **Dual Options**: every solution provides a default + fallback path.  
- **Risk Rule (Barbell)**: 85% safe base + 15% exploratory testing.  
- **Output Skeleton**: ≤30-word conclusion → 3 key points → steps → dual options → final insight.  
- **Modes**: FLEX (default), GUARD (risk reminders), AUDIT (full review).  

👉 For the **full system prompt**, see [`docs/system-prompt.md`](docs/system-prompt.md)  
or the appendix in the AFP Whitepaper.
